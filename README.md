A python, matplotlib project to track all the planets.

The Script helps to find best time to observe any planets.
It plots the planets positions in solar system fot any given date.
  relative to sun, 
  relative to earth, relative to constellation,
  and relative to sun rise/set timing.
  
The planets positions needs to be downloaded from NASA website to "Planets data" folder.

  Positions are stored as Rectengular system in 
  Solar Ecliptic Coordinate System (SE)
